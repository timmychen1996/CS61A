#### CS61A
This is the course that I enroll in Berkeley as 2017.   There are labs and projects.
Below is the image for one of the project that is called Ants.
There are ants and bees in the squared block, and if the bee go to the other side(ant's part), he will win vice versa.
In the class, we only implement some of the py.file, others such as GUI design are already provided.
